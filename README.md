- **Abstraction** ‚Üí `View` interface implemented by `CustomerView` and `ShopKeeperView`  
- **Polymorphism** ‚Üí Different implementations of `displayMenu()`  
- **Inheritance** ‚Üí Unified behavior through interfaces  
- **Collections Framework** ‚Üí `ArrayList<Product>` used in `ProductStore`  
- **Exception Handling** ‚Üí Custom exception `ProductNotFoundException`  
- **Clean Structure** ‚Üí Separation of views (`CustomerView`, `ShopKeeperView`) and business logic (`ProductStore`)
